Codefuel_Page
=============

Ever needed more page templates than your default 1column.phtml 2columns etc? This module comes with the ability to assign different templates. By default you can have a separate template for the home page, category, product, static page and contact. 

You may also have a custom body class for each of these sections.

Enjoy!
