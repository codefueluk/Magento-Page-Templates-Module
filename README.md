Codefuel_Page
=============

Ever needed to have more page templates than your default 1column etc? This module comes with the ability to assign more than these default templates to the homepage, category, product and static pages. 

1. Copy module files to your project
2. Refresh the cache
3. Go to the static pages in the admin area, edit Home page. Under Design change the layout dropdown to Home page

The static pages, category and product will work straight away.

Enjoy!
